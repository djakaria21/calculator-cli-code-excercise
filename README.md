# calculator-cli-code-exercise

## Description of solution

This solution uses inquirer (and will add more things) as a framework for creating the cli and node (of course).

I decided to go with inquirer after considering many other packages due to the ease of use after considering other cli node packages such as ink and pastel.

Inquirer also doesn't have security vulnerabilities, and is regularly updated.

The reasoning behind not going with the react based cli creation tools is the lack of working examples as well as the repository not being updated for literally 2 years.

## Nice to haves

To finish, the actual calculator, also adding security, testing, and perhaps try to update the react cli node packages to actually have working examples, or get the existing samples to work.


## How to run
